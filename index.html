            <p>Many medical errors are due to the fact that people in charge of patient or elder's medication have to deal with sorting huge amounts of pills each day. This paper consists on the conception, design and creation of a pillbox prototype intended to solve this deficiency in the medical area as it has the ability of sorting out the pills by itself as well as many other advanced features, with this device being intended to be used by hospitals or retirement homes. This medication pill box is focused on patients who frequently take medications or vitamin supplements, or attendants who deal with the more seasoned or patients. Our smart pill box is programmable that enables medical caretakers or clients to determine the pill amount and timing to take pills, and the service times for every day. Our shrewd pills box contains nine separate sub-boxes. In this manner, medical caretakers or clients can set data for nine distinct pills. At the point when the pill time has been set, the pillbox will remind clients or patients to take pills utilizing sound and light. The warning of pills should be taken will be shown by an android application which is held by the patient. Contrasted and the conventional pill box that requires clients or attendants to stack the crate each day or consistently. Our shrewd pill box would essentially discharge medical attendants or clients' weight on much of the time preloading pills for patients or clients and overlook the measurements which must be taken.

            This is a red paragraph.There can be a lot of individuals out there who need constant help – may it be our elderly people, family members, the ones who have special needs. Elders are more affected by the timing of taking a certain drug than others, in order to prevent any dysfunction or illness timing is a must [1], [2].

            But as with aging comes poor eye sight and poor memory, what if the patient has a dementia like Alzheimer. Some people may forget to take the medicines at the correct time and can forget the medicines which they have to take. In order to eliminate the factors of always needed observation like nurses or taking a risk of a missed dose, we had to find an easy, portable and efficient solution. Pill boxes already exist but most of them are either has limited use, doesn't fit for elder ages or even has a big size that makes it not suitable to take it with you anywhere [3], [4].

            In order to make a really useful smart pillbox it had to be easily integrated with the recent sweeping smart technologies. While at the same time it had be fit for the elders and their limited knowledge and experience to implement the ease of use. Size and portability was also an important fact that we had to keep in mind [5], [6], [7].

            For it to be called smart, its connected through a wireless network, which enables it to be connected to the internet for future applications and integration, also its distinguished by the wide range of the Wi-Fi instead of a Bluetooth or any other field communication, and erase the need for any wires or wired connection which enables portability in the first place. Through that same network its connected to the mobile phone, which with it you can set the timing interval for the dose and also notifies you by many ways when the dose time comes. Also, we added a buzzer with a LED to make a type of physical warning, so that it leaves you no choice but to remember the pill time and take it [8], [9].
            The aim of this study is to build a Smart Pill Box for Medicine Reminder and Monitoring System. When the pill time has been set, the pillbox will remind clients or patients to take pills utilizing sound and light. The warning of pills should be taken will be shown by an android application which is held by the patient. Contrasted and the conventional pill box that requires clients or attendants to stack the crate each day or consistently. This model can aid in help elders to take their medication.

            The rest of the paper is described as follows: In Section 2 describe the problem statement; Section 3 presents the basic concept of elders problems; section 4 presents the main objective of the research; section 5 presents previous work. Section 6 presents the proposed smart reminder system model; Section 7 presents the research design; Section 8 presents the proposed framework for smart pill box; Section 9 presents the implementation of the proposed model; section 10 presents the experimental results of proposed model. Finally shows the conclusion.As pills have taken such an important role in everyday life there has been the past years an increase in the number of medical neglect cases related to incorrect medication given to patients, such as the case of the nurse who gave a patient a paralytic instead of an antacid that was prescribed by the doctor, causing the patient's death [10]. After seeing so many of these cases it is evidently crucial that the correct pill is taken by the correct person at the correct time, otherwise taking an incorrect one or not taking one at all may expose the patient to several dangerous situations, ranging from mild health issues up to death [11].

            Other cases of wrong pills being ingested by patients are caused by patients themselves, especially at an old age. As people grow old the human body tends to malfunction and the number of pills the average person has to take when certain age is reached greatly increases, were, according to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, more than 40 percent of Americans age 65 and older take five medications a day [12]. Usually they are a wide range of different pills an elderly has to take at different times. Keeping track of taking the right pill at the right moment each day can become a challenging experience for the elderly, as it is not as easy as it could be for a younger person. This fact is easily explained when we understand that many of the abilities such as sight, memory or logical capabilities tend to decrease in a proportional way to age once human beings have entered old age, making it difficult for them to remember which pill to take at the correct time, remembering to take them or confusing one pill with another as the person may not be able to distinguish one from another thanks to their decreased sight as well as the similarity in the pills forms and colors. This problem will most surely be a cause for concern for the people surrounding the pill-taker, as not taking a pill at the correct time can cause severe problems (such as organ rejection in a patient with organ transplant or heart attack in patients suffering from grave heart conditions) [13], [14].

            On the other hand several problems related to the high amount of pills nowadays are prescribed to patients are found in hospitals or in retirement homes. In these places on of the main jobs is to give out to its patient the correct pills. Managing, sorting and giving out the pills to each one of the patients can sometimes have a high chance of error, with a patient or resident receiving one or more incorrect pills.
            Finally there are situation where taking an incorrect amount of pills is a matter of the patient's inexperience and/or ignorance. No matter the cause, it has been proven that there is a significant risk of people ending up swallowing the incorrect medication or dose.Alzheimer's is the most widely recognized type of dementia, a general term for memory misfortune and other intellectual capacities sufficiently genuine to meddle with day by day life. Alzheimer's illness represents 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Alzheimer's isn't an ordinary piece of maturing. The best-known hazard factor is expanding age, and the dominant part of individuals with Alzheimer's are 65 and more seasoned. In any case, Alzheimer's isn't only an illness of seniority. Around 200,000 Americans younger than 65 have more youth-full beginning Alzheimer's infection (otherwise called early-beginning Alzheimer's) [15] B.Missed dose

            The build ‘missed dose’ is integral to numerous appraisals of medication adherence. Nonetheless, few examinations have explored how patients or clinicians conceptualize missed dosages or the degree of the concordance or harshness amongst clinicians and patients. Generally speaking, patients revealed a stricter meaning of missed measurements than did clin-icians. Fifty-five percent of patients suspected that a pill-taking postponement of 6 h past the endorsed dosing time constituted a missed measurement, by correlation, just a single doctor concurred with this evaluation. More than 33% of patients believed that the best possible reaction to a missed dosage is skipped it through and through, yet just around 12% of clinicians concurred [16].The main objective of this model will be to solve the above-mentioned problems by designing and create a tool which will enable the owner to track every pill to ingest in an easy and simple way requiring no training or complex learning from their side in order to operate the device. This device will be an intelligent pill dispenser.

            The pill dispenser will be designed to prevent errors in hospitals and retirement homes where many pills have to be given daily to each one of the patients, each patient owning a device will not only drastically reduce the chances of errors occurring but also well optimize and speed up work for the caretakers/nurses by allowing the device to take care of pill management for them and freeing the time slot usually dedicated to that.

            This device is intended to log the pill name, number of pills and hours at which each pill is actually taken versus the time it should have been taken. Nowadays there has been an increasing awareness as the number of pills prescribed to elder people, stating that so many pills may have negative effects on the patient's health. The pillbox's logs will help gather data concerning this matter.
            There is a need to ensure the device is wirelessly connected so device management (defining the hours when a particular pill must be taken, number of pills in each compartment, etc…) as well as possibility of emitting warnings to the owner's relatives or nurses if needed (such as the patient not taking pills).

            In essence, the device will have to be a wireless electronic apparatus, having special attention to make it very precise as an error could prove fatal.<h1><a href="#firts">top</a></h1>
